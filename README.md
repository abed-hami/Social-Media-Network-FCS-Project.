Social Network Graph Project:

This project is a simple implementation of a social network graph using Python. The graph consists of users connected through friendships, and it supports various operations like adding/removing users, establishing/removing friendships, and performing graph traversals such as BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and Dijkestra algorithm. 

Also, it includes recommendations based on interests and mutual friends. Moreover, you can list the users arranged and sorted by id, names, and friends number. 

Graph visisualiztion is also one of the key features of the project, with it you can visualize teh users their connections and weight of each connection.

With a comprehensive CLI and GUI users of the project can easily navigate through it and use its features.



Technologies:

1-Python

2-NetworkX (for vsualization)

3-TKinter (for GUI)

Usage Ways:

1- Use the customized CLI
2- Use the GUI


How To Use:

1- Create user by inserting name and email
2- Create friendship between users and weights to friendship
3- If you want to unfriend just click remove friendship
4- Visualize connections 
5- Print sorted users by name, id, friends number
6- Use traversal methods (BFS, DFS)
7- Show each user recommended friends based on different criteria
